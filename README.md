The project is to detect kinds of vehicles moving on the street using computer vision, in the yolov8-live-master folder:
- The "best.pt" file is the weights file for the main program.
- The "main_video" file uses videos as inputs of the program.
- The "main_webcam" file uses the webcam to get the input for the program.
